                This Cookie Policy (“Policy”) explains that we believe in being open and clear about how we use your information. In the spirit of transparency, this Policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies on our Websites. This cookie policy applies to any Jeevansathi product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference.
             </p><br><p style="color: black; text-align: left; margin: 20px;">a. Does Shubham uses cookies?</p><p class="g">
                Shubham uses cookies, tags and other technologies when you use any of the Jeevansathi websites, mobile sites or mobile apps (collectively “the services”). Cookies are used to ensure everyone has their best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy. If you prefer not to receive cookies or web beacons, then you should stop using our site, or consult your browsing and third party cookie settings as described below.

<p style="color: black; text-align: left; margin: 20px;">b. What is a cookie?</p>
<p class="g">
    Cookies are small pieces of text stored by a website you visit in your browser and subsequently sent by your web browser in every request to the website. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Site or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Site more useful to you. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the Jeevansathi servers. Cookies allow Jeevansathi to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience on our site. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may analyse or perform analysis based on the use of these technologies and generate reports on an individual and aggregated basis.



<br><br>
Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to Shubham or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by Jeevansathi when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).   <br><br>
    Of course if you wish to maintain a higher level of privacy and confidentiality then you can go in for the second option. And if you want the maximum level of privacy then you can select the third option.

    <p style="color: black; text-align: left; margin: 20px;">c. What are cookies used for?</p>
    <p class="g">
        When you visit our Websites, we may place a number of cookies in your browser. These are known as First Party Cookies and are required to enable to hold session information as you navigate from page to page within the website. For example, we use cookies on our Websites to understand visitor and user preferences, improve their experience, and track and analyse usage, navigational and other statistical information. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Jeevansathi site, and bring customized features to you. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you elect not to activate the cookie or to later disable cookies, you may still visit our Websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of the Websites may be limited.
