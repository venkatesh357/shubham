                                possible through Shubham Matrimony! I am a businessman<br>
                                committed to my work. Shubham Matrimony found a life <br>partner
                                that my parents approved of. The Relationship <br> Manager, Mr Soheb,
                                showed me a few profiles and that's <br>when I saw Tanu, a dentist.
                                When we finally met,<br> sparks flew. She met my parents and they 
                                liked<br> her too. we married on 7th March 2020.

                        I wasn't just looking for a bride for my son, but an angel<br>that will
                        bring joy to his life and ours. I would like to thank<br> our Relationship
                        Manager, Mr. Nikhil. His patience,<br> dedication and thoughtful choices led
                        us to finding our well<br> educated, independent and traditional daughter-in-law.
                        The<br> horoscopes matched perfectly and most importantly, our<br> families liked each
                        other. My son's marriage is now<br> finalized. God Bless Shubham Matrimony!
